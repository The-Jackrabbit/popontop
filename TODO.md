- [ ] different interface organization (list on right, list on left)
- [ ] fix mobile save for settings
- [ ] fix bottom margin for title on mobile, alternatively, just create a <Layout /> for the mobile editor
- [ ] fix notch area not being recolored after leaving screenshot mode
- [ ] show success/error banner for chart delete
